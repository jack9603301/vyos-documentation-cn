"In the past serial interface have been defined as ttySx and ttyUSBx where"
" x was an instance number of the serial interface. It was discovered that"
" from system boot to system boot the mapping of USB based serial "
"interfaces will differ, depending which driver was loaded first by the "
"operating system. This will become rather painful if you not only have "
"serial interfaces for a console server connected but in addition also a "
"serial backed :ref:`wwan-interface`."

"To overcome this issue and the fact that in almost 50% of all cheap USB "

"bus it connects to. This somehow mimics the new network interface "
