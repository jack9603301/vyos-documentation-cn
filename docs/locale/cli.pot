#: ../cli.rst:127
msgid "**Saved configuration** is the one saved to a file using the :cfgcmd:`save` command. It allows you to keep safe a configuration for future uses. There can be multiple configuration files. The default or \"boot\" configuration is saved and loaded from the file ``/config/config.boot``."
